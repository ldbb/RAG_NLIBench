We begin by showing that tweets can be classified with over 75% accuracy as either accepting or denying climate change when using our methodology to compensate for limited labelled data; results are robust across several machine learning models and yield geographic-level results in line with prior research. We then apply RNNs to conduct a cohort-level analysis showing that the 2018 hurricanes yielded a statistically significant increase in average tweet sentiment affirming climate change.

Our contribution is threefold. First, geomstats allows the flexible modeling of many a machine learning problem through an efficient and extensively unit-tested implementations of these manifolds, as well as the set of useful Riemannian metrics, exponential and logarithm maps that we provide. Moreover, the wide choice of loss functions and our implementation of the corresponding gradients allow fast and easy optimization over manifolds. Finally, geomstats is the only package to provide a unified framework for Riemannian geometry, as the operations implemented in geomstats are available with different computing backends (numpy,tensorflow and keras), as well as with a GPU-enabled mode–-thus considerably facilitating the application of Riemannian geometry in machine learning. In this paper, we present geomstats through a review of the utility and advantages of manifolds in machine learning, using the concrete examples that they span to show the efficiency and practicality of their implementation using our package",

Also, if you do not worry about gaining weight, I guess this is a good way to get a sugar rush in a tiny can.

The Asian country was hit by a devastating earthquake and tsunami on Friday last week with over 5,000 people now confirmed to have died. One of Sauber's drivers, Kamui Kobayashi, is a native of Japan and was born in the Hyogo prefecture. He and Mexican Sergio Perez's cars will carry a message in Japanese at the Melbourne Grand Prix in Australia on March 27 that reads 'may our prayers reach the people in Japan.' Sauber's team principal Peter Sauber told Formula One's official website it was important the team did something to demonstrate their support. \"It is difficult to find the right words to express our emotions and feelings, but silence means we can't even begin imagine how to try,\" he said. \"We can hardly believe what we are seeing. Our thoughts are with the people in Japan. \"We hope they will have the necessary strength to overcome these circumstances of extreme adversity.\"",

According to her website, Rowling is working in collaboration with award-winning producers Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender on the project. \"Over the years I have received countless approaches about turning Harry Potter into a theatrical production, but Sonia and Colin's vision was the only one that really made sense to me, and which had the sensitivity, intensity and intimacy I thought appropriate for bringing Harry's story to the stage,\" Rowling said in a statement. \"After a year in gestation it is exciting to see this project moving on to the next phase. I'd like to thank Warner Bros. for their continuing support in this project.\" Warner Bros. is owned by CNN's parent company, Time Warner. Rowling will reportedly be a producer of the play and work with a writer, but she will not be writing the play. The story will follow Potter in his early years as an orphan. Directors and writers for the play, which will go into development in 2014, are currently being considered.",

Those who did not meet the height requirement of 5ft 3in (1.6m) were signed up into bantam battalions so their skills could still be used.
