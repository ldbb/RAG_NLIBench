Endogenous secretion of cortisol was suppressed with dexamethasone. A 24 h absorption test was performed on nine children. In six, percutaneous absorption was detected. The highest serum cortisol level was reached within the first 6 h. A 4 h absorption test was developed on the basis of the 24 h test. This short absorption test was performed on nine children, and in eight of them absorption of hydrocortisone was detected. The rise of serum cortisol ranged from 98 to 2669 nmol/l. The 2 h ACTH test was performed to evaluate the effect of previous treatment with topical glucocorticoids. Suppressed adrenocortical function was found in five of 13 children, and was associated significantly with high post-application serum cortisol levels. This occurred more often in infants with a severe skin disorder than in older children or in those with mild or moderate skin disease.",

A lymphocyte morphology scoring system was developed to quantify the density of microvilli: Grade 4 classified those lymphocytes with greater than 75% of the surface covered with microvilli with progressive decrements to grade 1, which were those without microvilli. The mean lymphocyte morphology score of eight normal individuals was 3.62 +/- .22. The mean lymphocyte score of WAS patients was substantially lower (2.89 +/- .27, P less than .001). In addition, WAS lymphocytes often were qualitatively abnormal, with short, blunted microvilli.

Evidence is presented that the chromosome with the beta zero-thalassemia determinant carries a gamma-globin gene quadruplication, perhaps in a -G gamma-G gamma-G gamma-A gamma-gene arrangement. The eight gamma-globin genes in this patient produced G gamma and A gamma chains in a 95 to 5 ratio, and nearly 99% of the patient's hemoglobin was of the fetal type. The clinical condition resembled that of a thalassemia intermedia. HbF levels in eight beta-thalassemia heterozygotes varied between 0.5 and 4.2% and the percentages of G gamma in this HbF averaged at 87% or 95%; this level is to some extent related to the haplotype of the normal chromosome. All subjects carried four alpha-globin genes; a new BglII polymorphism was observed within the psi alpha-globin gene.",

Neuraminidase treatment of 125I-labeled surface membrane glycoproteins (SMGs) from wt HL-60 cells converted the two-dimensional gel electrophoretic pattern to one having features in common with RA- and 6TG-resistant cells. However, neuraminidase treatment did not alter the sensitivity of wt HL-60 cells to differentiation induction by RA, hypoxanthine (purine base), or DMSO. These results indicate that differences in peripheral, neuraminidase-accessible sialic acids are important determinants of the gel electrophoretic mobility of the SMGs of the HL-60 line and sublines but are not likely related to the differentiation-resistance mechanism.

The three human defensins, HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3, lysed human and murine targets in chromium release and dye exclusion assays. Defensin-mediated tumor cell lysis was concentration-dependent, inhibited by serum, and dependent on temperature-sensitive events. Lysis was first detected by three hours of incubation and it reached a plateau between eight and 14 hours. In vitro exposure of murine teratocarcinoma cells to HNP 1-3 abrogated their oncogenicity in vivo. Nonmalignant target cells were also susceptible to defensin-mediated lysis. Four rabbit granulocyte defensins exerted marked (NP-1, NP-2) or moderate (NP-3a, NP-3b) cytotoxic activity, whereas defensin NP-5 was not cytotoxic. When tumor cells were incubated with human defensins in combination with hydrogen peroxide, synergistic cytotoxicity was detected. As defensins are released from granulocytes by various stimuli, their release could contribute to extracellular cytotoxicity which is independent of reactive oxygen intermediates.",

Ankle position and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. In 3 of 8 spastic patients tested, dorsiflexion evoked velocity-dependent activation of the antagonist (SOL) muscle which impeded the movement to the extent that the limb unintentionally reversed movement direction. We propose that this activation is reflex in origin since it is tightly synchronized, has a large peak amplitude, occurs about 50 ms after the initiation of the movement, and is velocity dependent. One of the 3 patients who had reflex-induced antagonist activation in dorsiflexion also demonstrated sustained clonus during plantarflexion. This usually occurred only if the target had been overshot so that the return of the limb stretched the soleus muscle and triggered clonus. We conclude that in some patients, hyperactive stretch reflexes cause movement deficits.",

After the intravenous administration of a moderate dose (4 mg/kg) to male Wistar rats, the transport of slow component a (SCa) was found to be retarded, transport velocity being decreased by 17% (0.85 +/- 0.06 mm/day vs 1.03 +/- 0.06 mm/day in controls). The transport kinetics of the fast anterograde and retrograde components (aFC and rFC) were unchanged after the administration of a dose of 6 mg/kg, although the relative amount of aFC was decreased by 27% (3.2 +/- 0.9% vs 4.4 +/- 1.1% in controls).

There was considerable overlap between these groups, and pigmentary retinopathy, present in 36% of patients, occurred in all three. At a mean disease duration of twenty years, 9 patients (all from Group 3) were severely disabled but 42 were still able to work. In vitro studies of mitochondrial metabolism, performed in 33 cases, most commonly showed deficiencies of the mitochondrial respiratory chain localized to complex I (18 patients) or complex III (9).

Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways. The relatively greater deficits observed in the older children, on the other hand, suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity.",

The changes observed in spouses were related in time to those occurring in patients on 10/13 occasions from 5/9 families; no temporal relationship occurred in the remainder. Taking two or more low T8+ values as significant, 12/13 patients, 7/9 spouses, 6/13 siblings and 4/13 controls (chi 2 = 12.5; P less than 0.01) were abnormal at some stage.

There is oedema formation at 2 h after smoke inhalation or fluid resuscitation and especially with the combination of inhalation injury and fluid resuscitation [corrected]. This oedema appears to have decreased by 24 h post-injury. There does not appear to be any difference between the small- and medium-sized tracers in the transit times of tracer in the lung vascular compartment. The increases in extravascular water volume have been confirmed by gravimetric analyses of the lungs. Thus the pulmonary oedema in the rabbit animal model is detectable within 2 h post-injury, with a return towards normal values some time within 24 h if fluid challenged for short periods. Fluid resuscitation exacerbates the amount of oedema that developed. The onset of pulmonary oedema may therefore be earlier than previously seen clinically, and fluid resuscitation modifications may be of benefit in smoke inhalation injury.",
