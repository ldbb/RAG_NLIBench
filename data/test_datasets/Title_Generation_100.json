Natural killer cells normalize at six months while we observed expansion of CD19(+)/CD5(+) B cells after three months and a persisting defect of memory B cells. Chronic graft-versus-host disease did not influence significantly those parameters for CD8 subsets while the naïve and competent CD4 subsets were strongly affected. But the most profound impact of chronic graft-versus-host disease was on B-cell subsets, especially on the memory B population. The cumulative incidence of late severe infections was low (14% at four years). Using Cox's models, only low B-cell counts at 12 (P=0.02) and 24 (P=0.001) months were associated with the hazard of developing late infection, in particular if patients did not develop chronic graft-versus-host disease.",

DNA vaccines are currently used in veterinary medicine, but have not achieved widespread acceptance for use in humans due to their low immunogenicity in early clinical studies. However, recent clinical data have re-established the value of DNA vaccines, particularly in priming high-level antigenspecific antibody responses. Several approaches have been investigated for improving DNA vaccine efficacy, including advancements in DNA vaccine vector design, the inclusion of genetically engineered cytokine adjuvants, and novel non-mechanical delivery methods. These strategies have shown promise, resulting in augmented adaptive immune responses in not only mice, but also in large animal models. Here, we review advancements in each of these areas that show promise for increasing the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines.",

Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid because normal cells can not only synthesize arginine de novo but also take up extracellular arginine. Several types of tumors have abnormalities in arginine metabolism enzymes and completely rely on extracellular arginine to support necessary biological processes. This property is referred to as arginine auxotrophy. Taking advantage of characteristic arginine auxotrophy in tumors, arginine deprivation, which is generally induced by the use of arginine deiminase (ADI) and arginase I, has been investigated as a novel strategy for cancer therapy. Arginine deprivation demonstrated promising efficacy against arginine-auxotrophic tumors. By integrating perspectives from both clinical oncologists and laboratory scientists, this article reviews the important aspects of arginine deprivation as a promising anticancer therapy.",

In this work we formalize dependency parsing as the problem of selecting the head (a.k.a. parent) of each word in a sentence. Our model which we call DENSE (as shorthand for Dependency Neural Selection) employs bidirectional recurrent neural networks for the head selection task. Without enforcing any structural constraints during training, DENSE generates (at inference time) trees for the overwhelming majority of sentences (95% on an English dataset), while remaining non-tree outputs can be adjusted with a maximum spanning tree algorithm. We evaluate DENSE on four languages (English, Chinese, Czech, and German) with varying degrees of non-projectivity. Despite the simplicity of our approach, experiments show that the resulting parsers are on par with or outperform the state of the art.",

In turn, generation of Aire(+) mTECs then fostered Skint-1-dependent, but Aire-independent, DETC progenitor maturation and the emergence of an invariant DETC repertoire.

Percutaneous entry of mite antigen was demonstrated in skin biopsies by Fe-staining. Scratched skin first showed an urticarial reaction typical of type I allergy which later changed into an eczematous reaction typical of type IV allergy. This change was also shown histologically.",

        "input": "The field of Distributed Constraint Optimization has gained momentum in recent years, thanks to its ability to address various applications related to multi-agent cooperation. Nevertheless, solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) optimally is NP-hard. Therefore, in large-scale, complex applications, incomplete DCOP algorithms are necessary. Current incomplete DCOP algorithms suffer of one or more of the following limitations: they (a) find local minima without providing quality guarantees; (b) provide loose quality assessment; or (c) are unable to benefit from the structure of the problem, such as domain-dependent knowledge and hard constraints. Therefore, capitalizing on strategies from the centralized constraint solving community, we propose a Distributed Large Neighborhood Search (D-LNS) framework to solve DCOPs. The proposed framework (with its novel repair phase) provides guarantees on solution quality, refining upper and lower bounds during the iterative process, and can exploit domain-dependent structures. Our experimental results show that D-LNS outperforms other incomplete DCOP algorithms on both structured and unstructured problem instances.",
