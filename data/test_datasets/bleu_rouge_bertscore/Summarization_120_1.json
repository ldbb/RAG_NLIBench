We begin by showing that tweets can be classified with over 75% accuracy as either accepting or denying climate change when using our methodology to compensate for limited labelled data; results are robust across several machine learning models and yield geographic-level results in line with prior research. We then apply RNNs to conduct a cohort-level analysis showing that the 2018 hurricanes yielded a statistically significant increase in average tweet sentiment affirming climate change.

Those who did not meet the height requirement of 5ft 3in (1.6m) were signed up into bantam battalions so their skills could still be used. The art works form part of an exhibition called \"There But Not There\". In Wales, it focuses on soldiers who were miners, but it will also run across England and Scotland.",
