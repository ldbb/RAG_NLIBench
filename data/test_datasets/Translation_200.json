Please keep them as they are in the translations. 4) Please do not localize measurement units like miles to kilometers during your translation. miles should be translated to its equivalent in your language. 6) Note the input is all lowercased except for fully capitalized special placeholders (e.g. NUMBER, DATE, TIME).

Då bör man tänka på att lagstiftningsprogrammet skall debatteras i februari, och därför skulle vi lika gärna kunna avstå från den debatten, för pressen och Internet skulle redan dagen därpå tillkännage programmet för alla medborgare, och det skulle inte längre finnas någon anledning för parlamentet att ägna sig åt frågan.",
